## Note
You'll need to install react before using any of this code. Also the graph for visits will not render if there are no entries on the database file.

## How to install react
Run this command
```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```
This will create a react framework in a folder called 'my-app'\
Once installation is finished, run the following commands to start it up

```bash
cd my-app
npm start
```

While still inside the 'my-app; directory, run the following commands to get external components necessary for rendering the calendar and graph. 
```bash
npm install react-datepicker
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
npm install recharts
```

Alternatively you can run it all in one line with this.
```bash
npm install react-datepicker react-bootstrap bootstrap recharts
```

## Copying code over
Once you have react installed, copy the files in this folder into the 'my-app' directory. When prompted to replace files say yes. You should now be able to have a page with the rendered components. 

## Built With
