## Note
You'll need to install react before using any of this code. Also the graph for visits will not render if there are no entries on the database file.

## How to install react
In the current folder (`/website/` relative to the project root) run:
```bash
npm install
```
## Running the test enviornment
Run the application server from the root server with:
``` bash
python app/ptracker.py
```
and run the website from the `/website` folder with:
``` bash
npm start
```

## Build
Run:
``` bash
npm run-script build
```
